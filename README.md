###  Technical Notes
    - AES encryption with CBC mode and PKCS5 padding
    - Password-based key derivation using PBKDF2 and random salt
    - Random IV generated per encryption
    - The original file extension is stored inside the encrypted payload
    - Can encrypt/decrypt files: .txt, .pdf, .png, etc). Images and text files work fine. Bigger files and directories yet to be implemented.
